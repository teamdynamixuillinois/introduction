# Introduction
This organization holds the TeamDynamix scripts used for the University of Illinois system. This is also meant to be a repository to help other areas access TeamDynamix and coordinate third-party scripts to TeamDynamix. 

All other repositories in this organization are internal. Please contact <itsm-ipt-group@office365.illinois.edu> if you have any questions about this repository.
